# sTunes-View-For-PowerBI

A (one) view avoids the problem of having to refresh multiple tables of new data. It is only the view that refreshes correctly or doesn't. The data is queried from the view. Further, the view is considered clean data, the data one needs to create visuals. 

The following is a list of certain syntax used in the RDBMS SQLite.

# sTunes-View-For-PowerBI

A view is a stored query which runs and returns a tabular result set. It's a virtual table. 

A view avoids the problem of having to refresh multiple tables of new data. It is only the view that refreshes correctly or doesn't. The data is queried from the view. Further, the view is considered clean data, the data one needs to create a semantic model and visuals. 

The following is a list of certain syntax used in the RDBMS SQLite.
